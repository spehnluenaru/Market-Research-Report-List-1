<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photoresist Removal Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Photoresist Removal</li><li>Negative Photoresist Removal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The photoresist removal market is categorized into two main types: positive photoresist removal and negative photoresist removal. Positive photoresist removal involves the elimination of photoresist materials that become soluble upon exposure to light, allowing the underlying material to be etched away. Conversely, negative photoresist removal targets materials that harden upon exposure, making the unexposed areas easy to wash away. Both methods are essential in the semiconductor manufacturing process, ensuring precise patterning and maintenance of device integrity.</p></p>
